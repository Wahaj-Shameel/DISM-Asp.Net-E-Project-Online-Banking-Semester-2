E-Banking Project:
Welcome to my second e-project: E-Banking! This platform allows users to perform various banking operations like transactions and withdrawals with ease. It's built with ASP.NET MVC, C#, and a touch of JavaScript to bring everything together.

Technologies Used
ASP.NET MVC: For the robust and scalable backend
C#: The heart of the application
JavaScript: Adding interactivity and a seamless user experience
About This Project
This E-Banking system is a part of my Diploma in Information Systems Management (DISM), a prestigious program offered by Aptech Learning Pakistan. It showcases the skills and knowledge I gained during my second semester.

Feel free to explore the code, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or suggestions!
